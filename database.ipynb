    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases. \n",
    "A1. What is a database?\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of information. Databases are used to store and manage vast amounts of data, making it easier to access and query that data when needed. They are a fundamental component of modern software applications, ranging from simple to complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database typically consists of tables or collections, each containing rows or documents, and columns or fields, which define the structure of the data. It provides mechanisms for querying, updating, and managing data while ensuring data integrity and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiating between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "1. Structured Query Language (SQL) databases are relational databases that use a structured schema to define the data model.\n",
    "2. Data is organized into tables with predefined schemas, and each table contains rows with related data.\n",
    "3. SQL databases enforce ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data integrity and reliability.\n",
    "4. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.\n",
    "5. SQL databases are well-suited for applications with complex data relationships and transactions, such as financial systems and e-commerce platforms.\n",
    "6. They use SQL queries, which are powerful and expressive for data manipulation and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "1. NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that do not rely on a fixed schema, allowing for more flexible data modeling.\n",
    "2. Data is stored in various formats, including key-value, document, column-family, and graph databases, depending on the type of NoSQL database.\n",
    "3. NoSQL databases prioritize flexibility and scalability over strict consistency and often adopt the BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) model.\n",
    "4. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB (document-based), Redis (key-value), Cassandra (column-family), and Neo4j (graph).\n",
    "5. NoSQL databases are suitable for applications with rapidly changing data requirements, high read/write workloads, and distributed systems.\n",
    "6. They use various query languages or APIs, which are tailored to the specific database type and use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application. SQL databases are suitable for applications with well-defined schemas and complex data relationships, while NoSQL databases are a better fit for applications that need flexibility, scalability, and can tolerate eventual consistency. The decision often comes down to factors such as data structure, query complexity, scalability needs, and development preferences.\n"

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example. \n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for defining, managing, and manipulating database structures. DDL commands are used to define the structure of a database, including creating, altering, and dropping tables, indexes, and other database objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of how the CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE DDL commands are used with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE:\n",
    "   - The CREATE command is used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas.\n",
    "   - Example: Creating a new table named \"Employees\" with columns for employee information.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "       EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       FirstName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       LastName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       Department VARCHAR(50)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP:\n",
    "   - The DROP command is used to remove existing database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas.\n",
    "   - Example: Dropping the \"Employees\" table if it's no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER:\n",
    "   - The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding, modifying, or dropping columns in a table.\n",
    "   - Example: Adding a new column \"Salary\" to the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "   ADD Salary DECIMAL(10, 2);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE:\n",
    "   - The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all rows from a table but retains the table structure.\n",
    "   - It is faster and uses fewer system resources compared to the DELETE command when you want to delete all rows from a table.\n",
    "   - Example: Removing all records from the \"Employees\" table while keeping the table structure intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DDL commands (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE) are essential for defining, modifying, and managing the structure of database objects in SQL. These commands help you create and maintain the schema of your database, making it possible to store and manage data effectively.\n"

    "Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example. \n",
    "DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, and it is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to interact with and manipulate data stored in a database. DML statements are primarily used for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on database records. Here, I will explain the three main DML statements: INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, along with examples for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INSERT:\n",
    "   The INSERT statement is used to add new records (rows) into a database table. You specify the table name and provide the values to be inserted into the respective columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   Let's say you have a table called \"Customers\" with columns: CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, and Email. You want to add a new customer to the table:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   INSERT INTO Customers (FirstName, LastName, Email)\n",
    "   VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This SQL statement will insert a new row into the \"Customers\" table with the specified values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. UPDATE:\n",
    "   The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a database table. You specify the table name, set the columns to new values, and specify a condition to identify which rows should be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   Let's say you want to update the email address of a customer with a specific CustomerID:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   UPDATE Customers\n",
    "   SET Email = 'new.email@example.com'\n",
    "   WHERE CustomerID = 123;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This SQL statement will update the \"Email\" column of the customer with CustomerID 123 to the new email address.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DELETE:\n",
    "   The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more rows from a database table. You specify the table name and provide a condition to identify which rows should be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   Let's say you want to delete a customer with a specific CustomerID:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DELETE FROM Customers\n",
    "   WHERE CustomerID = 456;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This SQL statement will delete the customer with CustomerID 456 from the \"Customers\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the fundamental DML operations that allow you to manipulate data within a database. It's essential to be cautious when using DELETE and UPDATE statements, as they can permanently modify or delete data, and incorrect usage can lead to data loss or corruption. Always make sure to have proper backups and use these statements with care.\n"

    "Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example. \n",
    "DQL stands for \"Data Query Language,\" and it is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for querying and retrieving data from a relational database. SQL is a standard language used for managing and manipulating data in relational database management systems (RDBMS), such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. DQL specifically focuses on the querying aspect of SQL and does not include commands for modifying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common DQL statement in SQL is the `SELECT` statement, which is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. Here's an explanation of the `SELECT` statement with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SELECT`: This keyword is used to specify that you want to retrieve data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `column1, column2`: These are the names of the columns you want to retrieve data from. You can specify one or more columns separated by commas. If you want to retrieve all columns, you can use an asterisk (*) instead of listing specific column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `FROM table_name`: This part of the statement specifies the table from which you want to retrieve data. You should replace `table_name` with the actual name of the table you want to query.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `WHERE condition`: This is an optional part of the statement that allows you to filter the rows returned based on a specified condition. The condition is typically a logical expression that evaluates to either true or false for each row in the table. Rows for which the condition is true are included in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have a table called \"employees\" with columns \"employee_id,\" \"first_name,\" \"last_name,\" \"salary,\" and you want to retrieve the first and last names of employees whose salary is greater than $50,000. You would write a `SELECT` statement like this:\n",

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key. \n",
    "Primary Key and Foreign Key are two important concepts in relational database management systems (RDBMS) that are used to establish and maintain relationships between tables in a database. They play a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and defining the structure of a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Primary Key:\n",
    "   - A Primary Key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row or record in that table. It enforces the uniqueness constraint, ensuring that no two rows in the table can have the same values for the primary key columns.\n",
    "   - Key characteristics of a Primary Key:\n",
    "     - Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique across all rows in the table.\n",
    "     - Not Null: A primary key column cannot contain null (empty) values.\n",
    "     - Single or Composite: A primary key can consist of a single column or multiple columns (composite key) if a single column is not sufficient to guarantee uniqueness.\n",
    "     - Automatically indexed: In most databases, a primary key is automatically indexed, which can improve the speed of data retrieval.\n",
    "   - Example: In a \"Customers\" table, the \"CustomerID\" column can be set as the primary key because it uniquely identifies each customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Foreign Key:\n",
    "   - A Foreign Key is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a link between the data in two tables, creating a relationship. The foreign key in one table refers to the primary key in another table, creating a relationship between the two tables.\n",
    "   - Key characteristics of a Foreign Key:\n",
    "     - Referential Integrity: It enforces referential integrity, which means that the values in the foreign key column(s) must match the values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table.\n",
    "     - Can Contain Null: Unlike primary keys, foreign keys can contain null values. This allows for optional relationships.\n",
    "     - Helps Maintain Data Consistency: Foreign keys help maintain data consistency by preventing the creation of \"orphaned\" records in the child table, ensuring that every related record in the parent table exists.\n",
    "   - Example: In a database with \"Orders\" and \"Customers\" tables, the \"CustomerID\" column in the \"Orders\" table can be a foreign key that references the \"CustomerID\" column in the \"Customers\" table. This establishes a relationship between orders and customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a Primary Key is used to uniquely identify records within a single table, while a Foreign Key is used to establish relationships between tables by referencing the primary key of another table. These concepts are fundamental to relational databases and help ensure data integrity and consistency.\n"

    "1. `mysql.connector.connect()`: This function establishes a connection to the MySQL database server using the provided host, username, password, and database name.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `cursor()`: The `cursor()` method creates a cursor object associated with the database connection. The cursor object allows you to execute SQL queries and fetch results from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `execute()`: The `execute()` method is used to execute SQL queries. You can pass the SQL query as a string to this method. If your query includes placeholders (e.g., `%s`), you can provide values for those placeholders as a tuple as shown in the examples. This method is used for executing SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and other SQL statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `fetchall()`: After executing a SELECT query, you can use `fetchall()` to retrieve all rows from the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `commit()`: After executing INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE queries, you need to call `commit()` to save the changes to the database.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query. \n",
    "In SQL, the clauses in a query are generally executed in a specific order, and this order is important for understanding how the query works. The typical order of execution for SQL clauses in a SELECT statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM:** The FROM clause specifies the tables or views from which you are retrieving data. It is the first clause to be executed, and it determines the source of the data for the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **JOIN:** If your query involves joining multiple tables together, the JOIN clause is executed after the FROM clause. This clause combines rows from different tables based on a specified condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **WHERE:** The WHERE clause is used to filter rows from the tables specified in the FROM and JOIN clauses. Rows that do not meet the specified conditions are excluded from the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **GROUP BY:** If you are using aggregation functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc., along with GROUP BY, the GROUP BY clause is executed next. It groups the rows that meet the conditions specified in the WHERE clause into sets based on the columns listed in the GROUP BY clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **HAVING:** The HAVING clause is used to filter the groups created by the GROUP BY clause. It operates on aggregated data and filters out groups that do not meet the specified conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **SELECT:** The SELECT clause is executed after the previous clauses have been applied. It specifies which columns you want to include in the result set. Any calculations or expressions in the SELECT clause are also performed at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **DISTINCT:** If you use the DISTINCT keyword in your query, duplicate rows are eliminated from the result set after the SELECT clause has been executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **ORDER BY:** The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. It is executed after all the previous clauses have been applied, including SELECT and DISTINCT.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **LIMIT/OFFSET:** If you want to limit the number of rows returned by the query or implement pagination, you can use the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses. These are applied after the result set has been generated and sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT:** If you are using set operations like UNION, INTERSECT, or EXCEPT to combine multiple result sets, these operations are performed after the individual result sets have been generated by the previous clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that not all queries include all of these clauses, and the order of execution can vary depending on the specific query requirements. Additionally, some database management systems may optimize the query execution plan, rearranging the order of execution to improve performance while still producing the correct result.\n"
